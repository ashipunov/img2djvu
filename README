djvupages is a command-line djvu pages manipulator and editor wrapper.
Script has three options for pages and several modes options. See --help
for more information.

djvupages depends on bash, getopt, seq, tac, mktemp, sed, DjVu Libre
(djvm, djvused and ddjvu), (in case of --gimp mode) on GIMP and img2djvu
and (in case of -c mode) on ImageMagick.

djvupages can delete multiple pages, split DjVu file (i.e., select one
part of it), move several pages to different place, chop to individual
DjVu files, extract selected pages as TIFF images, edit one page in file
(through GIMP and img2djvu) and process pages with ImageMagick 'convert'
command.

To merge DjVu files or insert one DjVu file into another, see 'man djvm'.

Example:

$ djvupages -f 3 -l 5 --select file.djvu

will select pages 3, 4, and 5 and place them into separate file
